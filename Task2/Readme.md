# Underwater Image Enhancement Project

## Main Task

Enhance underwater images using various deep learning techniques. [Link to dataset](https://kaggle.com/datasets/b498391bea2bc8b0c6301bf2cd8820ef3bca6896e07ce2a50b54a62859db050e)

## Subtask

### Subtask 1: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Implement and train a VAE for underwater image enhancement
- Generate enhanced images using the trained VAE

### Subtask 2: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - MNIST Practice
- Learn about GANs
- Implement a basic GAN for the MNIST dataset
- Train and evaluate the GAN on MNIST

### Subtask 3: GANs for Underwater Image Enhancement
- Implement a pix2pix generator and PatchGAN discriminator
- Train the GAN on underwater images
- Generate enhanced images using the trained GAN

### Subtask 4: Diffusion Models
- Implement a diffusion model for image enhancement
- Use boiler plate code provided for starting
- Train the diffusion model on underwater images
- Generate enhanced images using the trained diffusion model

## Conclusion
- Compare results from all three methods (VAE, GAN, Diffusion) based on PSNR, MSE and SSIM scores.
- Determine which method performs best for underwater image enhancement
